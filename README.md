# Starter_Kit_Gulp_Sass_Atomizer_Bootstrap
This project is ready-to-use tool chain for front end development with
- Gulp.js
- Sass
- Atomizer (for atomic css)
- Bootstrap

I love semantic CSS class names, but I have also learned the power of Atomic CSS styles. I believe that an effective workflow for front-end development uses a combination of several styling approaches:
- Bootstrap (or other framework) for common, reusable styles
- Semantic CSS styles written only for custom UI components that will be reused throughout the site
- Atomic CSS styles for everything else to speed development and minize bloat and complexity of CSS files
